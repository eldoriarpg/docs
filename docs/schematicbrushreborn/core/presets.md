Schematic Brush has two types of presets:

# Presets

The base command to manage your presets is `/sbrp`

Presets in general contain one or more schematic set including its modifiers. Presets can be loaded into an existing brush when configuring it.

You can load multiple presets on one brush. Adding another preset to a brush will not remove or change previously added presets. In general, you can always think of adding a copy of this preset. Also, changing the modifier won't change anything on the preset.

# Brush Presets

The base command to manage your brush presets is `/sbrpb`

Brush presets contain schematic sets and their modifiers. Additionally, they also contain the placement modifier of the brush itself. You can directly load a brush preset by using `sbr loadbrush <name>`. After loading the brush, you can change it as you want. Loading a new brush will override your current settings.
