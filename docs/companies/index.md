# What is companies

Companies is a order based trading plugin.

What sounds simple is a highly optimized system for best usability and user experience.
Companies requires nearly no commands for users. All functionalities are available via rich Text UIs. 

The core of the plugin are the companies which accept and fulfil orders and the players which offer orders to the companies.
The whole system is anonymous to stop players from avoiding orders by specific players.

Every user can create orders. The player offers an amount of money in exchange for materials. When adding a new offer, players will see average price guidelines for the item they want to order. This helps them finding a reasonable price.\
The offer is then published to the companies. Players can form companies and accept orders from players.
After the order is delivered by the company, the participating players receive their money based on their contribution.

To keep players busy companies can be leveled up based on delivered orders/items and earned money. A higher company level can allow more members and parallel orders .

Limits and settings are customisable. It also provides an API and integrates vault for easy communication with other plugins.

The plugin is also able to run on multiple servers in parallel.
