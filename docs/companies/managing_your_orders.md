## Creating a order
Open your order menu with the `/order` and press on the `[New Order]` button. Define a name for your order which will help you identify it in your order list. This name will be also visible to the companies, which will claim this order

This will bring up the order editor

Materials and price are configurable limits set by your server admin.
Currently you would be able to add up to 5 different materials with a total amount of 512 items.

Lets add a new item with a click on add

The last argument is the price. This will be the price of the amount of stones in our case. We will pay `1` to receive 64 stone. Additionally the plugin will show you the average, max and min price for 64 stone in the past and current orders to give you an understanding about the current price of this material.

Now we can at any point modify the amount and price of our entry. We can also remove it by using the buttons on our entry.

Once we are done with creating our order we will press on the `[Done]` button. Our order was created and is now ready to be claimed by a company.

## Receiving a order
Once your order got delivered you will receive a message. You can simply press on the button to receive your items.

If you didn't receive your items, for example because your inventory was full you can also get your goods via the `/order` menu, click on `[Info]` and on the `[Receive]` button.
